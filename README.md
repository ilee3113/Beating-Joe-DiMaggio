# Beating-Joe-DiMaggio

This is the start of my journey to try and beat Joe DiMaggio. If you are thinking, "Who is this Joe DiMaggio and why does it matter?" then please sit tight as there lies $5.6 million jackpot for the first person who can beat Joe. Now hopefully that has caught your attention to join me on my journey.

For starters, this project centers around America's Pastime, a.k.a Baseball. The sport has seen a huge influx of data analytics since its inception, but still the main premise of the game is to "see ball, hit ball". So who is Joe DiMaggio? Joe DiMaggio was a professional baseball player that set the consecutive hitting record of 56 games back in 1941. Since then, there have been millions of people trying to unseat Joe and all have been unsuccessful. For those of us without the athletic ability of a professional athlete, MLB.com has an annual competition for the fans to live out their dream to beat Joe.

The MLB.com hosted competition [Beat the Streak](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/fantasy/bts/y2017/splash_index.jsp) lets users select one MLB player per day. If the selected player gets a hit, the user can continue their streak to the next day. If the selected player does not get a hit, the user's streak is reset to 0. The goal is to extend the streak past 56 and take home the prize.


## The Data

I will be mostly using data provided by the [Baseball Hack Day GitHub](https://github.com/baseballhackday/data-and-resources/wiki/Resources-and-ideas). This will be a good starting point to break down the data and start some EDA along with basic feature engineering.
